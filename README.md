## Introduction 

This repository is dedicated to my ongoing capstone project! I'm building a tool for Houdini that helps with setting up a Geographical environment and an urban landscape through an image with simple shapes and color codes.

## Purpose of this Project
* Automate the workflow needed to set up an environment quickly - a lot of effort goes into “figuring stuff out” in Houdini
* Support the translation of a 2D visual of an environment to a 3D
  * Well documented so that a user does not need incredible knowledge of Houdini to use the tool
  * Give the power to a user to create what they have in their mind very quickly - important for bird’s eye view shots, very specific environment maps, game design environments

## Personal Goals
* Build onto my portfolio for a TD/tools pipeline position
* Get acquainted with another 3D industry standard software & learn its in & outs
* Learn how to build tools for Houdini

## Future Goals
* Finish programming tool so that the terrain/color map is easily editable in Houdini
  * Change in color
  * Change in color saturation
* Finalize workflow for creating the water body in the environment
* Start programming tool that generates a water body within the terrain
* Learn more about texturing a terrain and what that workflow looks like
* Iteratively work on GUI through user testing
